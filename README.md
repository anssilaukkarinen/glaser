Steady-state heat and  moisture calculations according to ISO 13788

Note: The calculation of the amount of condensation does not currently work corrently when the amount of calculation layers per true material layer is increased. This leads to the situation that the amount of condensed moisture depends on the number of calculation layers per material layer, which is not correct. Fixing this is in the to-do list.
